1. Introduction
----------------

Romantic Encounters MOD for Baldur's Gate II (RE for short) is an add-on for
the game Baldur's Gate II, with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack.

The mod is compatible with original BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, and EET.

Romantic possibilities are endless. It could be a bit of flirting. Or several.
Some innuendo. A lovers' quarrel. A one-night stand. Or even several nights 
together - with a 'morning after' and without. A dream. Or something else?

We are attempting to give the protagonist of the game Baldur's Gate II these
opportunities. Some of the encounters are not explicit(PG-13, teen content),
some have adult content.

----------------
2. Installation
----------------

Windows:
--------

For original BGII, make sure that you have obtained and installed the latest official Bioware patch. Install the patch BEFORE installing any unofficial modifications.

To save you time and effort, for original BGII it is recommended to backup dialog.tlk, chitin.key, baldur.ini, bgmain.exe and override directory before installing any mods.
This way, you can restore your "clean install" in seconds by deleting weidu.log,
dialog.tlk, chitin.key, baldur.ini, bgmain.exe and override directory,
and restoring backups.

Note that if you use BGII Enhanced Edition from GOG or Steam, you need to prepare your game with modmerge before installing any mods: 
https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1

Make sure that Baldur's Gate II or ANY game-related utilities are not running.

To install the mod, unpack the archive and run Setup-RE.exe. 

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-RE.exe in your game directory.


Mac OS X:
---------

If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting
the new version.

To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder.
If properly extracted, you should have a RE folder,
Setup-RE, and Setup-RE.command in your BG2 folder.

To install, simply double-click Setup-RE.command
and follow the instructions on screen.

In case of difficulties:

1. Open the Terminal, type 'chmod +x' followed by a space, drag 
Setup-RE.command into the window, press enter.
2. Type 'chmod 755' followed by a space, drag Setup-RE
into the window, press enter.
3. Double-click Setup-RE.command,
the installation process should now proceed.

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-RE.command
in your game directory.


Linux:
-------
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.
Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from http://www.weidu.org/ and copy
WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. 

Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' 
and answer Y to both queries.

You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once 
in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's 
no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted 
only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you are unsure, 
running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

Run WeInstall gavin_bg2 in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine 
BGMain.exe and start playing.

Note that this mods assumes that you have oggdec for linux.

A lot of interaction and character development here. Beware, lest your CHARNAME

certain replies in your love talks(hint: if you do not like cream and cushions,
or collars and cuffs, Ribald might get ideas...)

The morning after the fourth talk, a choice must be made. Choose carefully,
and preferably save beforehand. If your choice is in accordance to Ribald's
own desires, you will get several more lovetalks - but only if you actually

-------------------------------------------

Nizidramanii'yt the Black Dragon, Scourge of Suldanessallar, Master of the
Sacred Cup. Nizidramanii'yt the Magnificent! Ever wanted to talk him out of his
plot coupon instead of fighting through vines and biting insects to lay this
magnificent, intelligent, sesquipedalian beast as a corpse in the dust? Perhaps

              RE_NiziLike  - affects the outcome(7+ is the best value)



54. Date Night, by SisterVigilante
----------------------------------

Date Night is an event for the Bioware romances that begins in the Temple
District once your romance has become committed (variable 2). Look out for
D'yana Quickly, a follower of Sune.

Four choices made at the beginning of the date will influence its outcome,
different for every character; some combinations will be more successful
than others. Your charisma score will influence one choice. Each character
has "good," "bad" and "perfect" endings (except Viconia, with whom "good"
is the best you can hope for). Perfect endings can be identified in that
they net you 10,500 XP.

If you are male and reach chapter 6 without a relationship, you can play
through Date Night with Imoen, although there is only one outcome.

(Spoilers!)

If you absolutely must get the ending you want, the Date Night "math" is
as follows:

Aerie: Fancy Dinner +1, Unique Dinner -1, Cheerful Song: +1, Sad Song -1,
Smooth convo +1, Use the book: +1, Awkward convo -1, Mugging: +1

Jaheira: Simple Dinner +1, Unique Dinner -1, Cheerful Song -1, Sad Song +1,
Smooth convo +1, Mugging doesn't matter

Anomen: Dinner doesn't matter, Cheerful Song -1, Sad Song +1, Smooth convo +1,
Use the book +1, Mugging +1 if you let him handle it, -1 if you don't.

Viconia: Simple Dinner -1, Unique Dinner +1, Cheerful Song -1, Smooth convo +1,
Awkward convo -1, Use the book -1, Mugging doesn't matter

Notes from the coder: this encounter will not recognize any mod romance
interests, i.e. if you're in a romance with Kelsey, you aren't getting a date.
If you are multiromancing, the game won't break, but we ain't troubleshooting
it anyway!

Available at: Temple District, D'yana is at the entrance
