@175  = ~A ploy? What is the meaning of this?~
@176  = ~Indeed? Well, this I can understand, at least. Too bad we cannot attack and show ourselves now... but all in due time.~
@177  = ~Obviously, I am a poor match for you, my lady, if you give yourself to another so freely. I shall not trouble you with my attention again.~
@178  = ~My lady! You and this thief - in this camp, in my presence!~ [RE_BLANK]
@179  = ~Do not take it so hard. He is just better than you.~

@181  = ~Anomen, he forced me into it somehow, I swear!~
@182  = ~I... I feel so empty without my soul...~
@183  = ~<CHARNAME>... I cannot take this. Surely you see this is a grievous slight to your honor! His blood should spill... or mine. There is no other way.~
@184  = ~Anomen! Honestly, I only spent a night in his arms. Is this a reason to kill an innocent man?~
@185  = ~Could we just forget it? I made a mistake, and I promise not to do it again.~
@186  = ~This is all my fault, Anomen. Please, forgive me.~

@197  = ~Ah. Very well, my lady.~

@200  = ~We are in Spellhold, among enemies. This is not the time.~
@201  = ~Anomen, the price I paid to be here was very high. He forced me to lie with him.~

@203  = ~No, Anomen, but I do not think you want to hear me tell you how he ravished me.~

@206  = ~I could not refuse any indignity, if it would give me a chance to pay back the man who tortured me.~
@207  = ~Actually, I loved it! His power, his violence, his animal lust thrilled me more than any whispered sonnet.~

@209  = ~It wasn't so bad, if you don't count the splinters.~
@210  = ~I would have done the same to rescue you, Anomen.~
@211  = ~My lady! I feared he might have ravished you! Alas, that you did not tell me before I could exact justice upon him!~
@212  = ~Anomen, he would have slain you where you stood. I hate him for it, but it is over, and we need never think of it again.~
@213  = ~I submitted willingly, but reluctantly. It was the only way to rescue Imoen!~
@214  = ~He did not rape me. I let him have his way with me so that I could pay back the man who tortured me and killed my companions.~
@215  = ~Whatever it was, it was not rape! His brutal mastery of me was thrilling!~
@216  = ~You say that now, but you would have done nothing!~
@217  = ~My lady! What are you saying?!~
@218  = ~I am saying that he forced me to endure the lowest humiliation in order to rescue Imoen and avenge my friends. Question me no more.~
@219  = ~Sometimes, it is necessary to sacrifice both honor and pride to achieve one's ends.~
@220  = ~He showed me how exciting it can be to lie with a powerful, dangerous man.~
@221  = ~That I never knew such ecstacy before he unleashed his lust upon me.~
@222  = ~Your trust means everything to me!~
@223  = ~The truth is that we have no time to speak of this.~
@224  = ~Do you really want to hear how he forced me to lie with him?~
@225  = ~Then trust me when I say that I never want to speak of it again.~
@226  = ~Anomen, sometimes sacrifice is necessary to help those that matter.~
@227  = ~He interrogated me. I do not wish to be reminded of it.~
@228  = ~My lady, I tremble with rage that the dog abused you thusly, but I see you are determined to speak no more of it. That you would endure such a thing to help another speaks better of your character than I ever could. I will honor your wishes, and not mention it again.~
@229  = ~My lady! That you could think so little of me!~
@230  = ~My lady, I am filled with regret that you would feel that way. I shall not trouble you with my attentions again.~
@231  = ~Helm's beard! Did you just lie with that loathsome scoundrel?!~ [RE_BLANK]
@232  = ~I did not want to, Anomen, but there is nothing I wouldn't do to help Imoen.~
@233  = ~I shudder at the memory, but I had no choice. We needed his help.~
@234  = ~He tricked me! He made me believe he could help us!~
@235  = ~Don't presume to judge me, Anomen. I took as much pleasure as I gave.~
@236  = ~My lady! I had not realized your devotion to your friend was thus. That he should deceive you so basely!~
@237  = ~For your sake, I would slay the rogue, but that would be no help to your friend. Let us never speak of it again.~
@238  = ~My lady! The thought sickens me! Did you actually *desire* him?~
@239  = ~No, Anomen. I did what I had to do to rescue Imoen.~
@240  = ~Actually, I did. And I enjoyed it.~
@241  = ~He is not as repulsive as you would make him out.~
@242  = ~My lady, I am almost loathe to ask, but... the rumor has it that this former gladiator, Hendak, and you... well, that is...~ [RE_BLANK]

@249  = ~Bed me? That he did.~
@250  = ~To what, Anomen?~
@251  = ~I do not understand what you are implying.~
@252  = ~How dare you! Cease accusing me of such base things at once!~
@253  = ~That he, instead of asking your permission to court you in an appropriate manner, is claimed to have entered an intimate liaison with you. Surely, this is an utter lie, but...~
@254  = ~I really do not know why you meddle in what does not concern you. Leave me be.~
@255  = ~I am not going to discuss this.~
@256  = ~This is not a lie. I slept with him.~
@257  = ~I indeed have feelings for Ribald.~
@258  = ~Surely, it is. Now let us move on.~
@259  = ~I apologize for overstepping my bounds, my lady. I am sure the rumors will stop, and soon, or I, Anomen Delryn, will put a bloody end to them!~
@260  = ~I truly wish we had put this behind us, my lady, but I must ask. Has anything transpired between Ribald and you?~ [RE_BLANK]
@261  = ~Yes, we did sleep together. But it is over now.~
@262  = ~I really do not want to talk about it, Anomen.~
@263  = ~Anything? Ha! Countless times!~
@264  = ~My lady, I must insist... I must know!~
@265  = ~Very well. I had an affair, but it is now over.~
@266  = ~Nothing happened between us! Nothing!~
@267  = ~Why would you ask? What business is it of yours?~
@268  = ~Just leave me be.~
@269  = ~My lady, this is most confusing... But I digress; I do not wish to trouble you with indelicate inquiries. Rest assured, I will smash the ruffian's head by your word.~
@270  = ~But if you would only talk to him in my presence, and end it once and for all, reassuring me these... most dark thoughts are baseless, I would be content.~
@271  = ~This filthy pirate! Irenicus be damned, I will tear him apart limb from limb for what he's done!~ [RE_BLANK]
@272  = ~A good idea, but somehow, I think it will be difficult to find him by then. Forget this, Anomen.~
@273  = ~He was... very charming, and I just couldn't resist.~
@274  = ~I loved the night I spent with him, and I do not regret anything.~
@275  = ~You I do not blame, my lady. You are so fresh and naive... a most fragile flower, truly... but this vagabond will pay for his crimes! If only finding Irenicus was not so urgent!~
@276  = ~I am sorry for such an unseemly display, my lady. Let us move on.~

@279  = ~I see. This is not what I would have expected of you in normal circumstances, my lady, but given your current state... Very well. Let us move on and speak of it no more.~
@280  = ~My lady, did you allow that drow to bed you?!~ [RE_BLANK]
@281  = ~Anomen, I had no choice! Our lives depend on keeping our disguise, and that means acting like drow.~
@282  = ~I didn't want to, but Phaere forced me to do it.~
@283  = ~I did, and it was the best I ever had.~
@284  = ~No, Anomen. He gave me a massage, but I refused any other... attention.~
@285  = ~Keep this quiet, please, but I sent him away before anything happened.~
@286  = ~Could you not have made some excuse? You all but jumped at the chance!~
@287  = ~Real drow do not object to the attentions of a pleasure slave. It means nothing to them! They aren't like us...~
@288  = ~I did try to refuse... or have you forgotten how reluctantly I agreed?~
@289  = ~Anomen, I did not let him... do it. But neither could I refuse to go with him without making Phaere suspicious.~
@290  = ~And why would I refuse the services of a highly skilled lover? It was good, Anomen. Very good.~
@291  = ~I went willingly, it is true, but I sent him away before he ever touched me.~
@292  = ~No, my lady, I have not forgotten your reluctance. But... but were you as reluctant when he offered himself to you?~
@293  = ~Even more so. I never let him touch me.~
@294  = ~He was just as dangerous as Phaere. I couldn't let him see me as anything but a drow. Please do not remind me of the ordeal.~
@295  = ~I was reluctant at first, but he was just so talented, I couldn't help myself.~
@296  = ~No, Anomen, I was not. I had no idea a man could make a woman feel the way I felt while lying with him.~
@297  = ~I went reluctantly, and I gave in to him reluctantly. He was beginning to doubt my disguise, so I had to make it convincing.~
@298  = ~I believe you, my love. We will never speak of it again.~
@299  = ~Truly? My lady, you are a marvel! Your words comfort me, and make me admire you even more.~
@300  = ~So you would have me believe that you lay in his arms, moaning under his caress, because you wanted to make it sound convincing?~
@301  = ~No! I hated every minute of it, and feel sickened by the memory. But had I not acted the way I did, our disguise would have been worthless.~
@302  = ~No, Anomen. I did not lie with him. He gave me a massage, and I told him that I had no further use of him.~
@303  = ~To tell you the truth, I lay in his arms, moaning under his caress, because he was a talented lover.~
@304  = ~My love... I forgot myself. I stand here as if I were the only one aggrieved, but surely it was you who was violated by that...~
@305  = ~But if you could endure something so vile, I will not spoil our disguise with my outburst. Let us speak of it no more.~
@306  = ~I am sorry, my lady, but I cannot abide the ease with which you give yourself to another. I shall not trouble you with my attention again.~
// Version 3
@307  = ~<CHARNAME>. Wh-what has just happened?~ [RE_BLANK]
@308  = ~I... spent a night with a young girl. I comforted her, but not in the way you think.~
@309  = ~Nothing. Do not concern yourself needlessly.~
@310  = ~Aerie, I am really sorry. Were you worried?~
@311  = ~Oh, really? And why should I believe you? She certainly was pretty enough!~
@312  = ~Very well! We are through, you and I!~
@313  = ~Was I... worried?~
@314  = ~<CHARNAME>, this girl... you barely knew her! And you showed her such attention... you never...~
@315  = ~Oh, just leave me alone! I do not want to talk with anyone... I'll talk to you l-later...~
@316  = ~Good morning to you.~ [RE_BLANK]
@317  = ~Good morning, Jaheira.~
@318  = ~I never touched her, Jaheira.~
@319  = ~Do not look at me like that. I tried to comfort her - poor thing was shaking!~
@320  = ~You took your time.~
@321  = ~I believe you. But what am I - what are all of us expected to think?~
@322  = ~This is not the time for petty squabbles. But I did not expect such behavior of you.~
@323  = ~I do not want to dwell on this. We should go down to the sewers and complete the task that is expected of us. Then we will talk... or not.~
@324  = ~Another damsel in distress, I see. What do I see in you, jaluk? Are you truly any different from the others?~ [RE_BLANK]
@325  = ~Viconia, I...~
@326  = ~I am sorry. But we did not sleep together.~
@327  = ~I am, and you know this.~
@328  = ~Don't you dare say anything, <CHARNAME>. I will not tolerate your snivelling apologies in addition to this indignity.~
@329  = ~I will not forget.~
@330  = ~I might just forget... some day. In the Underdark, I learnt many things about revenge. Thread carefully, <CHARNAME>.~
@331  = ~My lady, forgive my impertinence, but I cannot help noticing that you appear drawn to the company of other men.~ [RE_BLANK]
@332  = ~I am a friendly person, Anomen. There is nothing going on.~
@333  = ~Are you accusing me of impropriety?~
@334  = ~What right have you to be jealous?~
@335  = ~It serves as a pleasant distraction.~
@336  = ~Indeed, my lady, you have a most amiable nature. Your words reassure me.~
@337  = ~Nay, my lady, though I do wonder sometimes what you can find to talk about in private with these strangers.~
@338  = ~Just exchanging a few innocent words. Nothing to worry about.~
@339  = ~Jealousy, Anomen?~
@340  = ~It's none of your business.~
@341  = ~We were doing very little talking, as a matter of fact.~
@342  = ~Not jealousy... I merely wished to know...~
@343  = ~Never mind, my lady. I should not vex you with questions.~
@344  = ~My lady! I thought we had an understanding!~
@345  = ~We do, Anomen. I was just indulging in a little friendly conversation, nothing more.~
@346  = ~We are not married, Anomen!~
@347  = ~We do, Anomen. No conversation I have with a stranger is going to change that.~
@348  = ~A little variety keeps things interesting.~
@349  = ~Is my company so tedious, that you tire of it so readily?~
@350  = ~It isn't that, Anomen. I just like meeting new people.~
@351  = ~Yes, actually.~
@352  = ~I see. I cannot argue with your words, though they sting. I will let the matter drop.~
@353  = ~No? But my lady! You were gone such a long time! What could you have been doing?~
@354  = ~I meant that "we" were not doing a lot of talking. I was doing a lot of listening, even if I feared he might never shut up.~
@355  = ~Long wistful glances, silences filled with longing, that kind of thing.~
@356  = ~We lay together, Anomen.~
@357  = ~No, my lady, we are not...~
@358  = ~I shall speak of the matter no more.~
@359  = ~But... were your actions with him of the sort that would violate your marriage vows?~
@360  = ~No, Anomen, it's just that I find this jealousy misplaced.~
@361  = ~Perhaps, but that is not the issue. Anomen, I hold a sworn oath as sacred, but you and I have sworn no vows.~
@362  = ~Yes, Anomen... I am sorry. I never meant to hurt you. I never meant for things to go that far. It will not happen again.~
@363  = ~What do I care? It was very enjoyable.~
@364  = ~Variety?! My lady, what can you mean?~
@365  = ~I see. I will trouble you no longer with my attentions.~
@366  = ~My lady, something has been weighing on my mind. Some time ago, we spoke of the attention you have been allowing other men to pay you... private attention. At the time, I was reassured that you still desired my company, but I am no longer so certain. You still grant other men private audience, and I am very much mistaken if your conduct has been innocent.~ [RE_BLANK]
@367  = ~Anomen, these other men meant nothing to me!~
@368  = ~But my conduct has been innocent! Nothing happened!~
@369  = ~You are right, Anomen. I deeply regret what I did, and the hurt it caused you. I am very, very sorry.~
@370  = ~Your jealousy is making you imagine things.~
@371  = ~Oh, very well, I will come clean with you. I have been lying with other men, and I have been enjoying it.~
@372  = ~My lady, you swore that you would never again indulge in bedroom sport with another man, yet here it is, but a short time later, and you have been untrue to your word! How can I be assured that I mean more to you than the men to whom you give yourself so freely?~
@373  = ~Anomen, I spoke the truth to you then, and I am speaking it to you now. I have not lain with another man since telling you I would not, even if I did speak with others in private.~
@374  = ~It's different with you, Anomen! You, I care about.~
@375  = ~You will just have to trust me.~
@376  = ~Honestly, Anomen, keeping you is just too much work. Believe what you want. I'm done trying to please you.~
@377  = ~How easily you say that! How can I be assured that I mean more to you than the men to whom you give yourself so freely?~
@378  = ~But Anomen, I have not given myself to another man, even if I did speak with others in private.~
@379  = ~You said as much the first time I questioned you on the matter.~
@380  = ~(sigh) My lady, I want to believe you.~
@381  = ~You did not say your conduct was so pure the last time we spoke on the matter. You admitted that you lay with other men. Am I now to believe you are virtuous?~
@382  = ~You rend my heart! But you say that you are as torn by this as I...~
@383  = ~That you were so evasive the last time we spoke on this troubles me, but I know of no way to comfort my unease but to believe what you are telling me.~
@384  = ~You said as much last time we spoke on this. How can I now be assured of your sincerity?~
@385  = ~I have never lied to you, Anomen, even when the truth hurt. I would hope that my willingness to confess to something so painful might allow you to believe what I'm saying now.~
@386  = ~This is just too much drama. If you won't believe me, I'm done trying to make you.~
@387  = ~Indeed, my lady, it is not. When you make no secret of your secluded rendezvous in my presence, what am I to believe of your conduct while I am not there to see?~
@388  = ~I must do the honorable thing, even if you will not. I will trouble you no more.~
@389  = ~You ask much, to ask me to believe that.~
@390  = ~You say that as if you think I should be comforted, but I am not. My lady, I have treasured whatever affection you have bestowed on me, but it troubles me to think that you would give yourself so freely to one who meant so little to you.~
@391  = ~That isn't what I meant!~
@392  = ~I guess that means you aren't interested in me anymore.~
@393  = ~Is there nothing I can say to convince you of how I feel about you?~
@394  = ~Trust, my lady? You say the word as if it should excuse you of any misdeed, but you have given me little enough reason to believe you.~
@395  = ~I value commitment no less than you, Anomen, but I have broken no vow.~
@396  = ~Why should I prove myself to you?~
@397  = ~Have I not been honest with you? Every word I have spoken has been true.~
@398  = ~If you are going to be so stubborn, I do not need your trust.~
@399  = ~Indeed, my lady, you have not. Therefore, I will relent, and speak of this no more.~
@400  = ~But if my affection means aught to you, pray do not treat it so lightly.~
@401  = ~ Perhaps I am a fool to trust you so completely, but I do. If you say your actions have been pure, despite all appearances, I believe you.~
@402  = ~Perhaps I am a fool to trust you so completely, but I do. I believe your regret to be sincere. Come, let us put this behind us.~
@403  = ~It... it does, my lady.~
@404  = ~Is it not? You have lain with several men, but you would have me believe that this was pardonable, because you had no feelings for them? My lady, I would not value your favor so lightly, nor should you.~
@405  = ~You are right, Anomen. I have been a fool. Forgive me, please.~
@406  = ~Don't presume to tell me where or how I should bestow my favor, Anomen.~
@407  = ~There is wisdom in what you have said. I will think on this, and take it to heart.~
@408  = ~My interest, as you put it, has little to do with it.~
@409  = ~My lady... if your feelings for me were that strong, you would not have done what you did.~
@410  = ~Are you saying that you will no longer solicit the company of these crass strangers?~
@411  = ~Yes.~
@412  = ~I will do what I think is best.~
@413  = ~Who said they were strangers?~
@414  = ~Anomen, I cannot make any promises.~
@415  = ~My lady, I do not believe your regret to be heartfelt.~
@416  = ~I held you in the highest esteem, while you allowed others to use your body as if you were a common whore.~
@417  = ~Anomen, I have made a grave mistake. I had not realized my actions would affect you like this. I never would have done what I did had I known it would hurt you so much.~
@418  = ~Hey, I'm sorry, all right?~
@419  = ~You go too far, Anomen.~
@420  = ~This is getting tiresome.~
@421  = ~There you are again, my lady. This Sir Bjornin is surely an impressive paladin. I met him before, albeit only briefly. He really seems to be one of the bigwigs down in... Where was he from? Anyway, I think it was a good deed, oiling his scars.~ [RE_BLANK]
@422  = ~Yes, I really think it is a good deed, helping such a heroic warrior of good and righteousness by oiling his... scars. And logically, you couldn't do this down in the main hall, but had to go into a private, isolated, ... small room.~
@423  = ~I... I am sure I would have nothing to worry about, my love, if you go with a fellow Order member into a private room.~
@424  = ~No, I am sure there is nothing to worry about.~
@425  = ~Valygar, if you have a moment?~ [RE_BLANK]
@426  = ~Of course, Mazzy. What is it?~
@427  = ~I am concerned about your wellbeing, my friend. Forgive me if I seem to pry, but wouldn't it be more sensible to leave <CHARNAME> to her own devices? She has far more pressing concerns, after all.~
@428  = ~Mazzy, this is going too far.~
@429  = ~I know! But listen to me. Who else is going to tell you the truth? <CHARNAME> is a good and decent woman, and she seems to be genuinely concerned about you, as we all are, but we both know it is not going to do either of you any good!~
@430  = ~I am thankful for your concern, Mazzy, but I can decide for myself.~
@431  = ~(sigh) Will you at least consider my words?~
@432  = ~I will think on them, but I promise nothing.~
@433  = ~Thank you, my friend. I care for you both, and I would... hate to lose you.~
@434  = ~I notice you spend a fair amount of time with our leader.~ [RE_BLANK]
@435  = ~Would you have me explain my actions to you?~
@436  = ~Of course not. You are a man grown.~
@437  = ~Then why ask? ... Ah. You seek the lady's favor, as well, I see.~
@438  = ~She honors me with her friendship, and I will not allow anyone to compromise her.~
@439  = ~What would you have me do, then?~
@440  = ~Withdraw honorably, while you still may.~
@441  = ~Ah. But there lies the problem, doesn't it?~
@442  = ~So.~ [RE_BLANK]
@443  = ~So?~
@444  = ~You are still pursuing the lady, I see.~
@445  = ~Well, so are you. But...~
@446  = ~But?~
@447  = ~It will be over soon, one way or another. You were right, Anomen: I needn't have bothered.~
@448  = ~You... ? How dare you play with her feelings in such an offhand manner!~
@449  = ~I would have restrained myself if I could. But I have no choice.~
