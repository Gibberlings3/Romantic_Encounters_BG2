@145  = ~The look you're giving me can inflame even the strongest of dragonhide armors, do you know that? And when my breastplate burns, what shall we do then?~

@147  = ~I know I've said the words too late. I care for you deeply, but you have other obligations.~
@148  = ~But so be it. I shall remain by your side for as long as you will it. If it is to be love in the end, let there be love. If pain, let there be pain. Time will reveal whether I am enough.~

@158  = ~But it is a dark choice, hiding a part of myself. I've tried imagining lying in the dark, bound and hidden, and knowing that somewhere far above, under the sun, another me lives forever... and I couldn't find any joy in it.~
@159  = ~I do not want to hide my heart from you any longer, <CHARNAME>. I want to watch your hair flowing in the wind, laugh with you in the light of day, fight your foes back-to-back, see the world by your side. This grouchy ranger will not lock a part of his soul in a forest cabin.~

@176  = ~And open the door with your own key when the sun rises.~
@177  = ~If you lose it, I can always make another. But friends don't stand on ceremony: just blast the damn doors open, if you feel like it.~
@178  = ~Me, I'll have a bottle of cool wine and a crate of fireworks always ready for the occasion. But it'll have to wait until the Five are dealt with. Speaking of which, it is time to move on.~

@180  = ~So it is. Come on!~
@181  = ~Valygar... I changed my mind. I can't be with you. I'm sorry.~

@187  = ~Maybe we're just stronger.~
@188  = ~I love it when you agree with me.~
@189  = ~There's that. Remember that dragon in Suldanessellar? He certainly didn't expect to lose.~
@190  = ~I recall an old tale Mother told me long ago, before magic consumed her. It was a sad tale of darkness and betrayals, which said that heroes lead hard lives, sometimes lonely, often short.~
@191  = ~I didn't believe it then. Now I see what the tale meant. Without friends, the only difference between me and evil spawn like Illasera is our intent. And that changes by the hour.~
@192  = ~You mean you'd eventually become evil if you remained in your cabin?~
@193  = ~True. I'm tempted to kill all humans from time to time, myself.~

@196  = ~No. Maybe? I don't know. But I'm sure I won't become evil by your side.~

@198  = ~Is it? What of evil made in the name of good? I don't know if you're immune to that, <CHARNAME>. I don't know if anyone is.~
@199  = ~If our enemies could love, wouldn't all of this be different? If you cared deeply about someone, could you truly cause pain to innocents?~
@200  = ~I don't know. But I think true evil cannot love, and cannot even understand love without ceasing to be evil. If only our enemies had their own Gorion... what would happen then?~
