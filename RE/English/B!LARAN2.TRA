@112  = ~I arrived here but lately myself, worn and battered from my own fight to win entrance into the city. I had asked that a bath be brought into the room, there behind the screen. We might use it together, to nurture our own desire even as we erase the grime of the road.~

The water climbs only as high as your knees, but its coolness is refreshing.)~
@117  = ~(He dunks the sponge under the water, then runs it over your body, leaving a moist trail in its passage. He splashes himself with more vigor, but the cool water has little effect on the visible signs of his desire.)~

@131  = ~Yes!~
@132  = ~No! Stop!~
@133  = ~(Laran's eyes close as you wash his body. He moans softly at your soapy caress. He shivers at the touch of the rinsing water, but allows you to finish with visibly waning patience. At last, still dripping, he takes your hand and leads you back around the screen.)~

@140  = ~Er... yes, of course. Forgive me, lady, but I shall just stay here in the water awhile.~
@141  = ~(Laran moans softly as he enters you. He moves slowly, gently, as if he really intends to make it last all night, but such endurance as that might well be the reach of one not yet twenty.

@169  = ~You might have lasted longer, but you recovered quickly enough.~
@170  = ~Laran, we lay together as lovers. Do not ask me to rate your performance.~
@171  = ~Now that you mention it, there was a little room for improvement.~

@175  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>, you knew I was a paladin before ever you lay with me. For one such as I, devotion to duty must always overshadow personal needs, even when "personal" applies to one as lovely as yourself. I cherish the time we spent together, but it is time for it to end.~
@176  = ~As would I, did duty not compel me to leave your welcome embrace.~

@263  = ~You? You are not worthy to carry her cloak, Squire Laran. Leave her care to one with the strength and power to assist her.~
@264  = ~I need not carry her cloak, Sir Anomen. You belittle her power and independence. Let her choose one who will rejoice in her strength and assist in her goals, learning to be a strong partner, rather than an old warrior set in his ways.~
@265  = ~You are but a child, whelp, green and untried, unproven in combat! <CHARNAME> has not the time to train a youngling. She needs one who is proven ready to stand by her side, a strong shield bearer for her travails.~
@266  = ~Do you presume that your momentary lust provides fodder for a lifetime of consistent strength?~
@267  = ~Permission to speak freely, *sir*?~
@268  = ~Go on, boy. This is no matter for our Order. This is between us.~
@269  = ~With all due respect, sir, you are both insulting and wrong.~
@270  = ~My "lust" is my own business, and my ability to commit is unquestioned. I serve Torm with all my heart. I would serve <CHARNAME> with the same devotion. I do not give my word, my soul, or my body so cheaply. If you doubt my manhood, then I believe I must have satisfaction.~
@271  = ~Gods' blood, boy, your "manhood" is not the point! I do not doubt you serve your god with distinction. But you prove my point. You equate service of Torm with service of <CHARNAME>. That is your lust speaking, and your youth. She needs no worship, Laran. She needs a partner. You are too young or too foolish to understand the difference.~
@272  = ~(The sharp *snap* of Laran's gauntlet across Sir Anomen's cheek shatters the sudden silence.)~
@273  = ~(With graceful, deliberate slowness, Sir Anomen bends and retrieves the gauntlet.)~
@274  = ~Challenge given. Challenge received.~
@275  = ~If I should slip, and send you on to the next level of the Great Wheel, I will say prayers for your next assignments in the service of Torm.~
@276  = ~And I shall say prayers over your broken body, Sir Anomen, rejoicing that Helm has recalled a strong warrior for other duties. Shall we step outside?~
@277  = ~Gentlemen, desist! I will not have you fight over me like a pair of argumentative tomcats!~
@278  = ~Sir Anomen, this is beneath you! In this fight, there is no glory in victory, and naught but shame in defeat.~
@279  = ~Laran, please, do not do this! I would not want to lose you over petty jealousy.~
@280  = ~Stop! Both of you! Anomen, you have my affection, as does Laran, but I have sworn no vow of matrimony to either of you. Please, do not soil our dealings with blood.~
@281  = ~Show Laran what skills experience brings, Anomen!~
@282  = ~You can best him, Laran!~
@283  = ~(remain silent)~
@284  = ~Your whelp has issued a challenge, and I have accepted it. Would you shame us both?~
@285  = ~There is no honor in needless bloodshed! I've seen enough, without encouraging this petty rivalry.~
@286  = ~You shame yourselves by fighting over something outside your control. My heart is mine to give to whom I will, and neither of you will win it with violence!~
@287  = ~Oh, very well! Do as you will!~
@288  = ~My lady, would you have me shame myself by backing down from my own challenge?~
@289  = ~With pleasure!~
@290  = ~Then let me prove it!~
@291  = ~Then how would you have us end this?~
@292  = ~Just walk away. Laran, you have a duty to the garrison here at Saradush. Anomen, I need you to keep your level head. You both set great store by duty. Fulfill yours.~
@293  = ~You both profess devotion to me, so prove it by putting up your swords. In that way, you will both earn my respect, and you both will win.~
@294  = ~You could draw straws.~
@295  = ~Your words ring true, my lady. Would this satisfy you, Sir Anomen?~
@296  = ~It would, Squire Laran. I have learned to trust Lady <CHARNAME>'s wisdom. I should not have forgotten that.~
@297  = ~Then I will depart. My lady, I hold you in deepest reverence. Go in peace, and when the time comes, I will not have forgotten my promise.~
@298  = ~My lady, I have learned to trust your wisdom. I should not have forgotten that. Squire Laran, will that satisfy you?~
@299  = ~It would. By your mercy, Sir Anomen, I will depart. My lady, I hold you in deepest reverence. Go in peace, and when the time comes, I will not have forgotten my promise.~
@300  = ~My lady, your mocking words serve to enlighten, not goad. There is no honor in living or dying when neither would bring you joy. What say you, Sir Anomen?~
@301  = ~I say we listen to the lady. I have learned to trust Lady <CHARNAME>'s wisdom. I should not have forgotten that.~
@302  = ~Your preference?~
@303  = ~To first blood.~
@304  = ~As you wish.~
@305  = ~I have first blood! Do you yield?~
@306  = ~I yield. My lady, I am pleased you have such an able defender.~
@307  = ~Get thee gone, boy. There is something I need to say to Lady <CHARNAME> in private.~
@308  = ~Farewell. My lady... no, never mind. Lady <CHARNAME>, when the time comes, I will not forget my promise.~
@309  = ~I am glad that sorry task is done. I do not recall ever taking so little pleasure in victory.~
@310  = ~My lady, please forgive me. I was blinded by my own jealousy, and lost sight of the fact that you alone decide where to bestow your heart. Should you choose to bestow it on me, I shall strive to never again give you reason to doubt that decision.~
@311  = ~Squire Laran, you have first blood! I yield. I apologize for calling your devotion into question.~
@312  = ~Sir Anomen, I got lucky. Even I can see that you are more than a match for me in skill and strength. My lady, I am pleased you have such an able defender.~
@313  = ~Sir Anomen, you have once more reminded me of my duty. I must go. Farewell, Lady <CHARNAME>. I will not forget my promise.~
@314  = ~Go with Helm's blessing, boy.~
@315  = ~I am glad that sorry task is done. The boy did get lucky, but I have been a fool.~
@316  = ~Excuse me, my lady... do you know a Lady <CHARNAME>?~
@317  = ~Yes. I am she.~
@318  = ~No, I do not.~
@319  = ~Good. I have something for you. A squire in Saradush pressed it on me, with your description and name, and I'm glad to be rid of it. Must go!~
@320  = ~Heh, well, take it anyway. Some squire in Saradush pressed it on me, but I'm glad to be rid of it. Must go!~
