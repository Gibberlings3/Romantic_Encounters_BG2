In the low-down dirty run-around
My true love gave to me,
Yes, my true love gave to me!~

Completely square was the envelope

For a perfect square is my true love's head!
He will not marry me!
No, he will not marry me!~
@77   = ~Rectangular was the old inn door
My true love tried to sneak thru
Rectangular was the window there
By which I had to peek thru
Rectangular was the hotel room
I entered angrily
And rectangular is the wooden box
Where lies my love of the golden locks
They say he died of the chicken-pox...
In part I must agree:
One chick too many had he!~
@78   = ~Triangular is the piece of pie
I eat to ease my sorrow
Triangular is the hatchet blade

To a prize I had no wish to win!

@166  = ~You know, you were a real pain when we met last. I hope you provide better amusement this time.~
@167  = ~I thought we started off very well last we met. While I long to hear your voice, perhaps you would rather have a dance with me?~

@176  = ~My mother always told me the quickest way to a woman's heart was through laughter, and to a man's heart was several inches of steel just below the breastbone. But then again, I just made that up to impress you with my wit, as I didn't know my mother. Dance?~
@177  = ~Well, they say all the good ones are married, or claimed, or prefer men... you just got lucky, I guess!~
@178  = ~Well, if you get tired of all this singing and dancing, drop by sometime. I'm staying here, so I am easy to find, and I could always use your company.~

@219  = ~(She catches her lower lip in her teeth, and a blush rises up her chest.)~
@220  = ~(She gently moves your hand down onto her bare thigh, trapping your hand under her skirt, and begins gently stroking her leg with your fingers.)~
@221  = ~I do believe that there are some tensions which could be eased, <CHARNAME>.~
@222  = ~I desire more, Sheri... I want you.~
@223  = ~(You gently stroke the electric silk of her inner thigh, moving ever so slowly, your fingers seeking her warmth.)~
@224  = ~(You move forward swiftly, resting your fingers on her womanhood.)~
@225  = ~(She moves both her hands under the table, stroking you and teasing you, her fingers loosening your belt.)~
@226  = ~(As she finds her prize, her cheeks match her hair, and all you can see is red skin, green eyes, and blue dress.)~
@227  = ~(She gently takes your hand under the table, pulling it onto her bare thigh. Trapping your hand under her skirt, she begins gently stroking her leg with your fingers.)~
@228  = ~I do believe that there are some tensions which could be eased for both of us, <CHARNAME>.~
@229  = ~They say good things come to those who wait. And I think I cannot trust myself in a more private setting.~
@230  = ~(She leans forward and kisses you hungrily, her hands moving in very enjoyable ways.)~
@231  = ~Oooh - careful! Gently...~
@232  = ~(Her kisses rain fire on your neck, and her hands seek your pleasure under the table.)~
@233  = ~(You can feel her pulse in her throat, and very rapidly in other areas, as well.)~
@234  = ~Mmmmmmmm...~
@235  = ~(She grips your hand tightly between her thighs, and you find yourself dangerously close to exploding.)~
@236  = ~(Suddenly, startled, blushing crimson and panting heavily, Sheri disengages herself rapidly from you.)~
@237  = ~(She pulls away sharply, smoothing her dress, her face hidden by her hair as she rearranges her clothing under the table.)~
@238  = ~That feels wonderful. Gently, please, OH!~
@239  = ~(She leans back slightly and you feel her thighs move apart, opening to your advances.)~
@240  = ~(She considers you carefully, and frowns.)~
@241  = ~I do not think so. It is unlikely you would be more pleasant to me.~
@242  = ~Perhaps I was hasty. Yes, let us start over.~
@243  = ~I have heard many good things about your deeds... yes. I would like it very much if we could start anew.~
@244  = ~It is your loss, songbird, not mine. I am a strong lover.~
@245  = ~I was hasty too.~
@246  = ~I would like it very much as well.~
@247  = ~All this talk, and you are still not jumping in the sack with me. Don't you ever do anything more interesting with those ruby lips?~
@248  = ~Don't bother. After all, there are plenty of other girls here, and some of them are not as arrogant.~
@249  = ~Perhaps a dance? I think that would be an enjoyable restart to our conversation.~
@250  = ~(She stands up, and begins walking towards the dance floor.)~
@251  = ~(Gradually, she relaxes into your arms, warm and alive, nose to nose, eyes to eyes.)~
@252  = ~Nope... still too cold. Can't we go warm up together, start our own little fire?~
@253  = ~Sheri, I apologize, but I am really tired. I'm going to bed. I'm staying here, so I am easy to find, and I could always use your company.~
@254  = ~I have two words for you, <CHARNAME>, and they are not "Happy Birthday."~
@255  = ~*Now* you are talking! I'd be happy to oblige you.~
@256  = ~Yep, Courtesan's Guild. I knew it.~
@257  = ~There is no call for that kind of thought. I was joking. Obviously, it isn't amusing you. I am sorry - can't we start over?~
@258  = ~Don't all girls love bad boys?~
@259  = ~Not all "girls" like "bad boys", <CHARNAME>. In fact, many find them inane, boring, and pathetic. And I am a woman, not a girl.~
@260  = ~I have absolutely no idea why you continue to fascinate me.~
@261  = ~I do not know why I questioned your reputation. I assumed it could not be as bad as it is rumored to be.~
@262  = ~I do not know why I questioned your reputation. There are all sorts of stories, all of them contradictory.~
@263  = ~Your reputation is far better than the way you treat me. Is it just me, or all women that you treat so poorly?~
@264  = ~I am sorry, Sheri. I would like another chance, if you are willing.~
@265  = ~Well, at least I made an impression.~
@266  = ~Look, if you find me so interesting, why don't we go upstairs. I can tell you all about my life. You can explore me to your heart's content.~
@267  = ~Come on, girl. You know you want me. You just said so yourself.~
@268  = ~Look, I am not that great with women. Obviously, this whole thing isn't working so well. Can we please start over?~
@269  = ~He is no gypsy, my Father," she cried
'but Lord of these lands all over.
And I shall stay 'til my dying day
with my whistlin' gypsy rover.~
@270  = ~Only one problem with that song. I am no gypsy, nor am I lord of these lands all over. And besides, I really didn't hear, as I was busy admiring your eyes.~
@271  = ~That was beautiful. I liked the melodic extension you made by strophic use of the pentatonic ostinato pattern. I think. I was watching your throat.~
@272  = ~That was beautiful. I liked the way you attacked the melody, dueling it against the harp. I think. I was mostly looking at your eyes.~
@273  = ~That was beautiful. I liked the way you blended the melody, weaving it into an enchanting spell. I think. I was mostly looking at your eyes.~
@274  = ~That was beautiful. Your voice is truly a gift of the gods, as is your beauty. I think I was distracted. I was mostly looking at your eyes.~
@275  = ~That was beautiful. I would be tempted to abandon my order, and follow you just as the fair maid did follow her Gypsy, for you certainly have command of my heart. I am mesmerized by your eyes.~
@276  = ~That was beautiful. I have heard none better. I think I was distracted. I was mostly looking at your eyes.~
@277  = ~Yes, very nice.~
@278  = ~(One slim eyebrow arches, and she tosses her mane of vibrant red hair back, lifting her chin and looking down her nose at you.)~
@279  = ~You are not looking at my throat...~
@280  = ~In fact, you are looking slightly lower than that.~
@281  = ~Well, I would have gotten there eventually.~
@282  = ~I know. There are so many more delightful alternatives to view.~
@283  = ~My apologies, m'lady. I was distracted.~
@284  = ~You are not looking at my eyes...~
@285  = ~In fact, you are looking a bit lower than that.~
@286  = ~By Umberlee's Haggish Breath, I have never met such an arrogant ass in all my born days!~
@287  = ~You are forgotten, <CHARNAME>. I have a contract to sing here, but I am not required to be pleasant to the likes of you.~
@288  = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I have a contract to sing here, but I am not required to be pleasant to the likes of you.~
@289  = ~Perhaps another song for your ear?~
@290  = ~Perhaps.~
@291  = ~Perhaps something else?~
@292  = ~I can give you more than my ear, Sheri.~
@293  = ~Perhaps your ear is all I want. We bards enjoy an appreciative audience, you know.~
@294  = ~Of course.~
@295  = ~What do you have in mind?~
@296  = ~An audience? What I had in mind does not require an audience, though I have heard of places where there are such opportunities.~
@297  = ~(Her eyes dart to yours, and she grins. Lifting your glass quickly, she drains it and sets it down on the table, grabbing and tugging your arm towards the dance floor.)~
@298  = ~What am I doing! This is all so fast... I ... I can't do this! (She runs for the door, her blue silk dress rustling as she snatches her harp from the corner.)~
@299  = ~(laughs) Oh no, <CHARNAME>, my favors I reserve for single-room audiences only, thank you very much. And the audience must be far more than merely appreciative.~
@300  = ~And for your impertinence, you must dance with me. Here, I command it!~
@301  = ~My lady, I fear I cannot. I am not good at dancing. If you get tired of all this singing and dancing, though, drop by sometime. I'm staying here, so I am easy to find, and I could always use your company.~
@302  = ~As you wish.~
@303  = ~What, and waste all this good alcohol?~
@304  = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>. I am not here to force myself upon you. I will leave immediately.~
@305  = ~(She gathers her clothes and her harp, and leaves your room filled with the scent of roses.)~
@306  = ~(A quick light gleams from the doorway as Sheri slips inside, and braces herself against the quickly closed door.)~
@307  = ~(She pauses to see if you noticed.)~
@308  = ~(You do not move, feigning sleep.)~
@309  = ~(You watch her move gracefully and silently through half-lidded eyes.)~
@310  = ~(You roll over to face her, pulling the sheets down around your waist.)~
@311  = ~Hey, what do you think you are doing here?~
@312  = ~I have been waiting for hours, Sheri. Wouldn't you prefer to come over here and make yourself comfortable?~
@313  = ~(For a moment, you lose sight of her, but then suddenly Sheri stands above your bed, her eyes tracing your form under the sheets.)~
@314  = ~(She moves slowly closer to you, loosening the lacings on her dress.)~
@315  = ~(You stretch out, as if in your sleep.)~
@316  = ~Are you a vision, or reality? What are you doing here, Sheri?~
@317  = ~I have been waiting for hours, m'lady. Wouldn't you prefer to come over here and make yourself comfortable?~
@318  = ~What, couldn't get enough for your own room?~
@319  = ~(Her hands move quickly, silently, removing her harp and letting it rest by the side of your bed.)~
@320  = ~(You stretch as if in sleep, your arm dropping lightly over the side of the bed.)~
@321  = ~Sheri?~
@322  = ~You have me at a disadvantage, Sheri. I have no weapons here beyond nature's grace.~
@323  = ~That is an old game, <CHARNAME>... I may not be experienced in the ways of the bedchambers, but I have had occasion to slip in and out unannounced before. You are awake.~
@324  = ~I intend to, <CHARNAME>.~
@325  = ~And I intend to make you very comfortable, too.~
@326  = ~I have just the place for you to rest.~
@327  = ~I don't know what I am doing, <CHARNAME>.~
@328  = ~Rather, I know *what* I am doing, just not why I am doing it.~
@329  = ~What do you think I am doing, <CHARNAME>?~
@330  = ~(Warm laughter dances in the stillnes of the night, rough with desire, her bright teeth gleaming in the moon's blue light.)~
@331  = ~I am sorry that I left so quickly. I was a little... overwhelmed. But I am here now.~
@332  = ~This is dangerous, <CHARNAME>... but you are a melody repeating in my head, always crescendoing, never resolving.~
@333  = ~I must resolve this cadence, or I shall never be rid of your presence in my head.~
@334  = ~(Flame hair catches a fleeting moonbeam, leaping and dancing as if truly on fire.)~
@335  = ~You are beautiful. Come over here, so I can show you how much I desire you.~
@336  = ~(You sit up in bed, the sheets sliding down to your waist, swinging your legs over the side of the bed.)~
@337  = ~Sheri, I thought you said...~
@338  = ~(You move closer to her.)~
@339  = ~Come to me.~
@340  = ~Sheri, we should not be doing this.~
@341  = ~(Sheri leans close to you, her hands gently catching your chin, tipping your lips up to hers.)~
@342  = ~(Her soft ruby lips press against yours, her sweet taste filling your senses.)~
@343  = ~(You reach for her bosom, your hands deftly untying the lacings of her dress.)~
@344  = ~(You return the kisses, moving down her neck to kiss the soft pulse you see racing in her throat.)~
@345  = ~(You reach for her waist, undoing the ties holding up her dress.)~
@346  = ~(Her swift kiss silences you, and she straightens slightly.)~
@347  = ~I know what I said, <CHARNAME>... and I have changed my mind.~
@348  = ~So have I. Sheri, you should leave now.~
@349  = ~I am very glad to hear that.~
@350  = ~Well, in that case, I yield to your wishes. How can I serve you, my lady?~
@351  = ~(She giggles lightly into your mouth, and catches both your hands in hers, holding you at bay.)~
@352  = ~(She giggles lightly into the night, and catches both your hands in hers, holding you at bay.)~
@353  = ~(Standing away from you, she holds both your hands in one hand, and lays one gentle finger delicately on your lips.)~

@355  = ~Watch.~
@356  = ~(Sheri moves slowly, gently unlacing the front of her blouse, the silk tightening and dropping away slowly.)~
@357  = ~(Her blouse parts, revealing first the pert swelling half moons of her breasts, nipples peeking coyly from beneath their silk protection, then the slender line of her taut abdomen.)~
@358  = ~(Her hand hesitates.)~
@359  = ~Shall I stop?~
@360  = ~Gods, no. (You reach for her waist, pulling her close to you, warm between your thighs.)~
@361  = ~(You lean forward, your kisses moving now to her neck, now to her breasts.)~
@362  = ~(You suddenly and fiercely seize her shoulders, and pulling her down on top of you.)~
@363  = ~(You reach for her waist, tugging at the ties holding up her skirt.)~
@364  = ~Can you stop?~
@365  = ~Yes, stop. I am sure about this.~
@366  = ~Sheri, you should leave now. I am spoken for.~
@367  = ~I cannot stop now. I want you with me tonight. I want to be yours, if only for a time.~
@368  = ~(The soft silk slips from her shoulders, fully revealing her proud breasts. It falls about her elbows, pinning her arms as she seizes your face and brings you into her chest like an infant.)~
@369  = ~Shall I sing you a lullaby?~
@370  = ~Oh... or perhaps I should be singing a different tune... Oh yes...~
@371  = ~Oh, yes!~
@372  = ~I must have you now.~

@374  = ~(Your lips seek her, and you gently kiss each strawberry flower in turn.)~
@375  = ~(Sheri groans in pleasure as your burning kisses find her, and she catches both hands at the back of your head.)~
@376  = ~(The pale moonlight casts her face in shadow, but spills milky white across her navel as it reveals itself.)~

@383  = ~(She lifts herself away for a moment, reaching down between your body and hers.)~
@384  = ~(Her hand moves to you and touches you, guides you. She settles back carefully, slowly, her soft cries and pursed lips suddenly bright in the pale moonlight.)~
@385  = ~(She tosses her head back, arching her neck, her fingers suddenly brushing back flame as she sings out her joy at your presence.)~
@386  = ~So soft... so warm...~
@387  = ~(Sheri's small kitten cries of pleasure seek your ears as she now rolls beneath you, your kisses and touches entwining with the sheets.)~
@388  = ~(She presses up towards you, meeting you, matching you, seeking you.)~
@389  = ~You are there...~
@390  = ~(She squeals in delight as you thrust forward, and you find new energy in your striving.)~
@391  = ~... Deeper...~
@392  = ~gods, YES...~
@393  = ~(Your energies meet, and you seek each other's pleasure beneath the satin sheets, singing the melodies of life and continuance, of fire and beauty.)~
@394  = ~(sigh)~
@395  = ~(Sheri's look is unreadable as she rolls atop you, pulling the sheets up to cover herself modestly. Or at least more modestly. Her eyes study yours, and her hands absently brush her long hair back, off of your chest.)~
@396  = ~That was... inspiring. Inspired. (Sheri stretches luxuriously against the sheets, arching her back, one rosy nipple creeping out to peek at you.) I may not move for a very long, long time.~
@397  = ~(She looks at you questioningly.)~
@398  = ~Now, where were we... I believe m'lady was interested in a rematch?~
@399  = ~Well, that was interesting.~
@400  = ~Now, where were we?~
@401  = ~(Sheri slips off the bed, taking the sheets with her, gathering her clothes. Suddenly you notice that your purse is missing.)~
@402  = ~The coins... so you sought to take my purse?~
@403  = ~Never mind the coins, or the clothes - come back to bed, Sheri.~
@404  = ~Men and women have died for lesser offenses than stealing from me, Sheri.~
@405  = ~(She turns quickly, tossing her head, and her eyes burn through the moonlight with a fierce intensity.)~
@406  = ~I do not know why I came here.~
@407  = ~(She pulls her clothes about her, and leaves the coins where they have fallen.)~
@408  = ~I was not hunting for coins, but information. Yet you still elude my understanding.~
@409  = ~I burn for you, <CHARNAME>, but this flame is a deadly one. Its power would consume my life like a moth in flame. It is best I go now, while I still am my own woman, with my own life to choose.~
@410  = ~(She moves quickly to the door, and the sharp lantern light from the hallway flashes brilliantly across her form as she slips out.)~
@411  = ~(The door closes silently, leaving you to your abandoned bed and your memories.)~
@412  = ~I do believe we were discussing the limits of human endurance, m'lord, and perhaps challenging a few quaint notions?~
@413  = ~(Her hand lazily traces a ruby lock of hair like a paintbrush, tickling down your neck and collarbone, and her other hand engages in pursuits that leave no doubt as to her intent.)~
@414  = ~Assassin! You have been sent to kill me through lust!~
@415  = ~I am yours to command, m'lady bardess. A second verse?~
@416  = ~Perhaps I may delay awhile... in the meantime, perhaps I can entertain you. My singing leaves much to be desired, but lips can do many other things...~
@417  = ~(Sheri's giggles give way to breathless laughter and anticipation as you roll together in the moonlight.)~
@418  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... I was expecting a chanson, not a symphony! I look forward to your variations on a theme!~

@421  = ~(Her ambivalent smile at your presence has a trace of sadness.)~

@424  = ~I would tarry with you awhile longer, Sheri...~
@425  = ~You are my heart's desire, Sheri. I must be with you or die.~
@426  = ~It was a great night. Perhaps a rematch?~
@427  = ~Nah, I just came in for a drink. Are you still here?~
@428  = ~You were looking for information. So I was right after all, and you were just using me? I can respect that.~
@429  = ~You were looking for information. So I was right after all, and you were just using me? I should kill you.~
@430  = ~(Her eyes glitter with anger, and a trace of former lust, but she sighs and turns away.)~
@431  = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>. I am still here, but not for long. I know not what fascinates me about you, but it is a dangerous emotion, and destructive. I will not drink from that cup again this lifetime.~
@432  = ~No matter. I am just a quick fling, eh? Good enough for me.~
@433  = ~Dangerous or not, it was magnificent. Was it not powerful enough an experience for you, that you would discard repeating it?~
@434  = ~I cannot get you out of my mind, Sheri. Come upstairs, and let us contest wills again.~
@435  = ~Did you think I did not know your nature, <CHARNAME>? I may be young, but my sources are old and wise. You have a destiny that I cannot be a part of.~
@436  = ~Besides, I have my own matters to deal with.~
@437  = ~You are so beautiful, <CHARNAME>, and I have enjoyed your company... very, very much.~
@438  = ~(She stands abruptly, slinging her harp across her shoulders in a graceful sweep that sends her perfume washing over you.)~
@439  = ~My benefactor has recalled me to Waterdeep. I am to have a young charge there, to help guide her.~
@440  = ~Wait, Sheri... stay with me. You are my heart's desire!~
@441  = ~Go on then, run to your benefactor. You could have more fun on the road with me, though.~
@442  = ~So it is a brief affair, one night of passion... is that all?~
@443  = ~Fine. I didn't want complications anyways.~
@444  = ~Sheri, you are breaking my heart. Please, reconsider.~
@445  = ~(She pauses, considering, and abruptly turns back to you.)~
@446  = ~Your life seems touched by the balance of the gods - let us ask them. They wrote our melody, powerful, dissonant, and harsh though it was; let us toss a coin. Is this a chanson, or a symphony?~
@447  = ~Your life seems touched by the balance of the Gods - let us ask them. They wrote our melody, and lively and beautiful it was; Let us toss a coin. Is this a chanson, or a symphony?~
@448  = ~Hah! You have lost already, for my coin always lands on its edge! (You toss a coin quickly into the air, before she changes her mind.)~
@449  = ~I will not be bound by a coin toss... I am not a game, to be played and abandoned.~
@450  = ~Stay or go, it does not matter. The gods will bring you back to me.~
@451  = ~I would not stake such a treasure on chance, but I am slave to your will. I will spin my coin. (You toss a coin into the air.)~
@452  = ~Haven't you heard me? I've had my fun, and I don't need you any longer.~
@453  = ~(The coin spins lazily in the air, and you watch it drop as if in slow motion.)~
@454  = ~No... (Her hand snatches it from the air and it disappears from your sight... and from your life.)~
@455  = ~(She stops at the door, lingering, and tosses her head back, her ruby hair cascading against the door lintel, her eyebrow arched...)~
@456  = ~Who said it was your coin we were tossing?~
@457  = ~I choose chanson!~
@458  = ~Ah, but we all are a game, played by gods, fools, lovers, and madmen. I will toss. (She spins a coin high in the air.)~
@459  = ~No... (Her hand snatches it from the air, and it disappears from your sight... and from your life.)~
@460  = ~(She stops at the door, lingering, and tosses her head back, her hair of flame cascading against the door lintel, her eyebrow arched...)~
@461  = ~You are forgotten, <CHARNAME>.~
